Instagram Like

JSON file --> imagesURL, Like --> 
total images like --> total likes

Directive 
--> show us a image, button 
--> like/unlike (double tap)

grid --> (SCSS)
you can use jquery as well

Thought Process: 

1. use a controller to show the images on HTML ($http)
2. Using ng-repeat to format image and button
3. Using the $http, how we can get totalLikes using filter

Level 2 -->
img directive

div>
	img-directive
	button

parent would change the button

parent-child relationship with directive
button clicked and image's border is changed
