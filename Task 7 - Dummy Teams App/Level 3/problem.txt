users -> id, name, dummy messages (1st thing)
input box and button --> 
status (2nd thing)
global variable (active, away(30s), offline(1m))

localStorage for messages



learnings:-

1. template inside a directive must have only one root element but in my case, it was two. So it threw error.
2. the controller inside the directive has it's own particular objects  and variables. e.g. every html element will have its own $scope object.


--> 
1. Grid like
2. chatbox is directive
3. JSON have id 
4. messages will have scrollbar

Done -->

Now focus on the $timeout
